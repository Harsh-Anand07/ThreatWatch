## 🚀 Why I Built This

As someone diving deep into cloud security, I wanted to build something practical — something a real company might use. This project helped me:

- Understand how real-time threat detection works
- Explore how AWS services talk to each other in a secure, scalable way
- Learn by building — not just reading docs

---

## 🧠 What It Actually Does

This system acts like a **24/7 cloud watchdog** 🐶 for your AWS account:

- **Tracks API activity** using CloudTrail  
- **Monitors traffic** using VPC Flow Logs  
- **Detects threats** using GuardDuty’s built-in AI (like brute-force or malware)  
- **Triggers alerts** when something suspicious happens  
- **Sends you an email instantly** with the alert details

And all of this happens **automatically** — no manual intervention, no ML model training.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **AWS CloudTrail** – Tracks API calls and user activity  
- **Amazon VPC Flow Logs** – Captures network traffic within VPCs  
- **Amazon GuardDuty** – Uses ML to detect threats (e.g., SSH brute force, malware)  
- **Amazon S3** – Stores all raw logs centrally  
- **Amazon Athena** – SQL-based querying of logs in S3  
- **Amazon EventBridge** – Watches for suspicious events (like unauthorized access)  
- **AWS Lambda** – Sends real-time alerts when EventBridge rules match  
- **Amazon SNS** – Delivers security alerts via email  

---

## 🧪 How I Tested It

- Launched a test EC2 instance  
- Simulated a brute-force SSH attack  
- GuardDuty detected the attack and generated a finding ✅  
- EventBridge picked it up and triggered a Lambda  
- Lambda formatted the alert and sent it to SNS  
- Got an alert email in real time — it worked just like planned  
- Cleaned up all resources to avoid any billing surprises

## 💡 What I Learned

This project taught me way more than just connecting AWS services:

- The **difference between API logging and network logging**
- How **event-driven architecture** works in security automation
- That **you don’t need to be a machine learning expert** to use ML-powered tools
- The **importance of IAM roles and least privilege**
- Why **cleaning up unused resources** is as important as setting them up

| AWS Service         | Why I Used It                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GuardDuty           | AI-based threat detection                  |
| Lambda              | Real-time alert handler                    |

## 📬 Sample Security Alert (Email Format)

```
🚨 AWS Security Alert Detected

A suspicious activity was detected in your AWS environment.

Details:
UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
Severity: 5.3 (Medium)
Region: ap-south-1
```

## 🧼 Clean-Up Checklist

> One thing I’ve learned — never leave cloud resources running.

✅ Terminated test EC2 instance  
✅ Deleted CloudTrail trails (after testing)  
✅ Removed VPC Flow Logs  
✅ Disabled GuardDuty (after verification)  
✅ Deleted EventBridge rule and Lambda  
✅ Unsubscribed from SNS  
✅ Emptied & removed S3 buckets  
✅ Reviewed billing dashboard to confirm $0 usage  

---

## 🌱 What’s Next

- 🔍 Use **Athena** to analyze logs in S3  
- 📊 Add **QuickSight** or **OpenSearch** dashboards  
- 🔒 Enable **Auto-Remediation** (e.g., block malicious IPs automatically)  
- 🧠 Experiment with **Amazon Lookout for Metrics** (optional)

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

One of my goals was to keep this project **fully within the AWS Free Tier**. Here’s how I achieved that:

| Service         | Usage Type               | Cost       | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------------|------------|-------|
| CloudTrail      | Management events         | $0         | Free for 90 days |
| VPC Flow Logs   | Limited duration + filter | $0         | Cost-optimized by limiting scope |
| GuardDuty       | Free trial (30 days)      | $0         | Disabled after test to avoid charges |
| S3              | Minimal log storage       | ~$0.01     | Used infrequent access class |
| Athena          | No queries run (yet)      | $0         | Planned for later |
| EventBridge     | Small volume of rules     | $0         | Fits in free tier |
| Lambda          | Low invocations           | $0         | Free tier covers 1M invocations/month |
| SNS             | Email alerts only         | $0         | First 1,000 emails are free |

> ✅ Total Cost: **$0.01 or less** (Covered by AWS Free Tier)

⚠️ **Note:** I manually disabled/deleted all services after testing to prevent unexpected billing.
